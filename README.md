# TRUE-nanotribology

### TRUE Simulation
A TRUE simulation is defined as a **T**ransparent, **R**eproducible, **U**sable by others, and **E**xtensible. The concept was born to encourage researchers to set up project in a more standardized fashion, with the goal to improve the reprodicibility and scalability, as well as lower the barrier for new researcher entering any given project. Currently, there is no strict standard to build a TRUE simulation project, but there are a few principles that could be demonstrated through different examples workflow. Below is an example of a TRUE nanotribology screening project, which shows how researcher at Vanderbilt University have successfully inherited and significantly scaled up a TRUE project. 

### Original Project
The original project was developed by Dr. Andrew Z. Summers to study the tribological properties when two self-assembled monolayer (SAM) coated surface are sheared against each other. The project focus to study the effects induced by monolayer density, backbone chain length, and some terminal groups on the tribological properties of these surfaces, and have spanned approximately 820 state points.

The original project workflow could be found in several github repository hosted by the author Andrew Z. Summers:
- https://github.com/summeraz/monolayer_screening
- https://github.com/summeraz/terminal_group_screening
- https://github.com/summeraz/terminal_groups_mixed

### Current Project
Currently, new members of the project are extending from the original screening proejct to explore even more variables, scaling from the original 820 statepoints to an additional of almost 40,000 statepoints. In this repository, we hope demonstrate how a TRUE simulation can be set up, and how these projects can be readily transfered to and picked up by new member joining the research. The latter point would be extremely beneficial in academia setting where students constantly leaving (graduating) and joining the group.

### This repository
This repository serves as one instance of TRUE simulations. By making all the scripts used for preparing the system, running the simulation and data analysis, along with proper documentation covers every step, allowing users to modify and expand the project, this example satisfy every criteria of a TRUE simulation. Users can follow the process, starting from building the system to data analysis, in the provided jupyter notebook. We also include an example of how to effectively expand the project from the original simulated system, making use of the extensibility property of a TRUE simulation.
