    "## Batch run example of nanotribological properties workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "- Using SAM as coating to reduce coefficient of friction and force of adhesion when shearing between two surface\n",
    "- Many variables that can be varied and, hence, makes it a prime candidate for Computational Simulation\n",
    "- Several MD studies focusing on different properties\n",
    "    - Andrew Paper: backbone chain length, chain density, terminal groups\n",
    "    - Current screening project: mixed composition \n",
    "    - Near future project: backbone chemitries\n",
    "- The legacy encourage this research setup to be TRUE\n",
    "    - Future research can continue this project by varing and/or adding more variables based on the original project\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Model\n",
    "- Initialization of two surfaces coated with SAM - varying mixing composition, backbone chainlength, terminal groups\n",
    "- Two surface was then energy minimized through a few steps (by LAMMPS and GROMACS)\n",
    "- The two system is then compressed and sheared against each other (the top surface moving, and the bottom surface fixed)\n",
    "- The output is analyzed with mdanalysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Details\n",
    "- Initialze by MoSDeF\n",
    "- Fix overlaps by LAMMPS\n",
    "- Energy Minimize by GROMACS\n",
    "- NVT Equilibrate by GROMACS\n",
    "- Compress by GROMACS\n",
    "- Shearing at 5nN, 15nN, 25nN by GROMACS\n",
    "- Data Analysis with mdanalysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Screening\n",
    "- Near inifinite combinations means near infinite simulations\n",
    "- Need a way to efficiently manage the data space and workflow\n",
    "    - Signac - Dataspace management\n",
    "    - Signac-flow - Workflow management\n",
    "- Everything is manage under init.py (dataspace) and project.py (workflow)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "- Below is an example of how we can use Object Oriented Programing principles to scale up a project and make it TRUE. \n",
    "- For the sake of simplicity, the workflow only includes two steps, a initialization step to set a work space and an system building step. This is to show how we can efficiently iterate through the workspace and control the whole screening project.\n",
    "- All other step of a simulation workflow (energy minimization, equilibration, production) can be done in a similar manner."
